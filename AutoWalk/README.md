# Lethal Company - Auto Walk
Adds a rebindable key for toggling auto walk so you can give your W-key finger a break!

## Usage
Press the bound key (`K` by default) to toggle auto walking on or off.

Auto walking will automatically disable if you manually input a walking direction.

## Rebinding Controls
To change the key binding open the settings (in game or in main menu) and click "Change keybinds" and look for the item labeled "Auto Walk".

Auto Walk does not ship with a preset binding for controllers out of the box, but the option to set a custom controller binding is there if you want it.
